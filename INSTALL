To install lmdb++, just copy the "lmdb++.h" header file to a location of
your choosing. To make it available system-wide, you'd normally copy it to
/usr/local/include. Alternatively, you can embed it directly in your
project.

If you have `make', a Makefile is provided to facilitate installation:

    make install

    make uninstall

To facilitate packaging, the Makefile rules honor the DESTDIR and PREFIX
variables, in case values are provided for those.
