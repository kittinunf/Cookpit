# Cookpit
Flickr API implementation for Android with C++ core

## Requirement
* Android Studio
* android ndk and `ndk-build` on your PATH to build for android
* setup your ndk path in `local.properties` file at root of folder `Cookpit/local.properties`

For example:
```bash
ndk.dir=<your_ndk_path>
sdk.dir=<your_sdk_path>
```

## Installation
* Run `make android` at root folder
* Optionally, run `make android ARCH=all` for all available Android architectures

## Building
* Import `Cookpit/` into Android Studio

## Bridging Code
* `Cookpit/java_gen` and `Cookpit/jni_gen` contains all bridging code in Java/JNI generated by djinni's interface files in `djinni/`

## Architecture
* MVVM - Model(M) is sharing between iOS and Android with C++ code. VM(View Model) is a class on Kotlin provide necessary data for application to render. V (View) is purely on Android with Kotlin. V and VM are glued together with reactive paradigm in this project we use [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).
